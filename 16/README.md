# Day 16: Python

Again using a wrong tool for the job and proud of it.

Python may not be great at parsing but i **do** feel comfortable with it.
And when the only tool you have is an hammer...

Btw started with plain iterators instead of BitStream class. And of course
had to rewrite it, cause they don't support peeking. Meh.
