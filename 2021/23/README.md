# Day 23: Python

Well... This turned out to be more complex that I would hope for.

Overall this took me more than an hour I think. Which is a lot, considering
the "crux" of the task is a simple DFS solver - most of the complexity went
into encoding rules of the game. Didn't like it very much - I'd rather the
task was more fun and less tiresome.
