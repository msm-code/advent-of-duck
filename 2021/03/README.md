# Day 03: Jsonnet

Jsonnet is a data templating language designed for configuration generation.

So it makes perfect sense to abuse it for an AoC puzzle.

This is (like previous solutions, btw) not the way the language should be used,
or an example or a well-coded program. But it's fun and terse so hey, why not.
