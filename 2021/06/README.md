# Day 06: Sed / Awk

Everyone lokes oldschool unix tools, right? Let's use them to solve today's puzzle.

I've spent way too much time on the second part in sed.
By the time I realised this is a wrong approach, I've already wasted an hour or so.
I would have to implement way more cases for this to be efficient. You can find sorry
remains of what I've tried to do in 02.wip.sed.

So I've scraped that idea and "just" wrote the obvious algoritm in awk.
