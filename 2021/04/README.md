# Day 04: Racket

Time to dust off my old SICP book, scheme is back on the menu.

This time I've decided to do something less cursed than Jsonnet, but harder
than just throwing C# at it. I've always wanted to try racket, so it felt like
a good opportunity. On the other hand, I feel like I didn't really use the
full power of the language - I mean, there's not a single macro in my source.
And racket calls it self "language oriented programming language".

Well, maybe another time.

PS. Oh, BTW my solutions aren't correct - instead of keeping track of crossed
out elements, i replace them to zero. This is almost correct, except zero is a
valid input number - so it can make board win easier than it should. Works for
the provided input though, so good enough.
